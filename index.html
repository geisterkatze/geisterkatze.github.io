            <p>
                I'm Kai and I’m a software developer
                with a background in biological sciences, music and arts based in Berlin, Germany.
            </p>

            <a class="available" href="mailto:mail@xoxoxo.studio">
                available for hire?  YES!  currently looking for permanent position
            </a>

            <p>
                I mainly develop for the web, but also worked on numerous hardware
                projects including all kinds of micro controllers and
                computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi, CHIP, Electron).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Core skills:</strong> software development for web, UX design and
                tech assessment, data visualisations, hardware prototyping
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Interests:</strong> electronics, music
                production, analog video processing
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: I'm still in the middle of cleaning up all my old projects, adding one by one to my new github account.
                And I always have a hard time choosing what's "worthy". So that's why it doesn't have many projects at the moment.
                <br>I'm more than happy to talk about all my wonky projects though! <br>Just shoot me a mail.
